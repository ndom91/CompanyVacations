## üî® Todos

1. I want to make this more **"multi-tenant"** friendly. According to the 12-factor app methodology, we should be putting everything that is adjustable in the environment / a config file. The javascript variables are mostly taken care of, however, I need to template some more of the HTML and make that configurable as well.

2. **Language Strings** - Currently the strings in this application an awful mix of German / English. This needs to be standardized on English and the option given for other languages (German, etc.) via extensible strings files.

3. **Rethink database requirement** - Due to the fact that the requirements for persistence / statefulness of this application are relatively low, I've been debating moving to SQLite instead of a full fledged MySQL DB for this application. However, I have only limited exerience with SQLite so I'm not positive where, in terms of size / amount of data, the break point is between SQLite and MySQL databases and how appoproriate SQLite could be for this. SQLite would make the setup, maintenance, and deployment of this application much easier.
